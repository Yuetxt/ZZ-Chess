# OneMoveChess
A new way of playing chess where every each player only has one move for the day.
Anyone, regardless of skill, can make a move any of the chess boards available at anytime. 

Play and carry on with your day and check back in later to see what happened to your one move. Did your move change the outcome of the game?
